## General Information
Have you ever gone through trouble when configuring sensor details whwnever you change a network or location of a device built in arduino using Low cost ESP32 or ESP8266 controllers? This project is used to make a configuration portal to make dynamic  entries such as 
- wifi networks
- sensor Id
- APIs 

This project demonstrates how to Configure an mq2 gas sensor with a nodemcu(esp8266 based controller), whenever a sensor reading above the threshold is recorded, The controller sends a notification to whatsapp using the <a href= "https://www.callmebot.com">Callmebot</a>

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
